Execution starts from index.html, then main.jsx, then content in App as root node contains app.
App is called a component

In React, jsx files helps to write html code in js file and react gives this functionality. If the function names are in lower case as we have in normal html, it won't work. In JSX, react expect upcase letters for function declarations. In all functions in react, one line of html can get excecuted without issues, for more than one there needs to be a wrapper like div, else execution fails.

Framework vs Library

jsx is javascript xml and tsx is typescript xml.
