SEO - search engine optimization - Google ranks pages based on vitals after content which is the main component used by search engines. In case 2 web sites have same content then vitals help in ranking
Important Vitals
CLS - Cumulative layout shift (How much the page shifts while loading contents)
LCP - Largest contentful paint (how much time does the biggest element in page take to load)
FID - First input delay (Any input from user gets processed in how much time)

Lighthouse in browser can give a vitals report
